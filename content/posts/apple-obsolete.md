In a move that has sparked outrage on social media, Apple has officially designated the _iPhone 12 Pro_ as "obsolete." This means the device will no longer be eligible for hardware service at Apple Stores or Authorized Service Providers.

Users are complaining that the device is still perfectly capable. "It's barely 5 years old!" tweeted one user.

This move follows Apple's standard protocol, but many feel the timeline is shrinking.

What do you think? Is 5 years enough support? Let us know in the comments below.
