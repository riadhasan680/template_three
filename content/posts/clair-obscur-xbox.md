The turn-based RPG _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ has taken the gaming world by storm, shattering records for day-one Game Pass launches in 2025. Developed by a small indie team, the game features stunning visuals and a unique "reactive turn-based" combat system.

## Why It's A Hit

1. **Visual Style:** Using Unreal Engine 5 to its fullest.
2. **Story:** A deep, emotional narrative about a cursed expedition.
3. **Music:** Orchestral score that rivals Triple-A productions.

"We never expected this level of reception," said the studio head. "It's a dream come true."

If you have Game Pass, this is a must-download title this weekend.
