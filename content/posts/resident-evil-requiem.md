Capcom has dropped a new teaser for _Resident Evil Requiem_, and fans of the original game are going to be very happy. The brief 30-second clip showcases a mansion hallway that bears a striking resemblance to the Spencer Mansion from the 1996 classic.

### A Return to Survival Horror?

The developers have promised a return to the slower, more methodical pacing of the early titles. "We want players to feel the tension of opening every door," said the lead director.

The lighting engine looks phenomenal, utilizing the latest RE Engine upgrades. Shadows loom large, and sound design seems to play a crucial role in locating enemies.

> "It's not just about jump scares; it's about dread."

We'll have more on _Resident Evil Requiem_ as we approach its release date in early 2026.
